# 🎮 Enigma Engines

</div>
Welcome to the Enigma Engines. It is collection of Engines which I play on spare time to experiment on real dataset to implement machine learning models. The engines are implemented in Python. As starter, I have reimagined the Animal Crossing game by simulating an agent which tries to maximize the best action possible for villagers to achieve increased friendship and higher money. I am also working on adding a recommendation engine to simulate the best possible item to showcase to user based on session history.

## 🚀 How to Run

Setup is using uv package manager.
```bash
uv sync && uv pip install -e .
uv run python enigma_engines/animal_crossing/simulation.py
```
